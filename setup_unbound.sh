# FILE: setup_unbound.sh
# DESCRIPTION: A script to install and configure Unbound as a fully recursive DNS resolver
# with security and privacy hardening. 
# This script is designed to be called from the main setup_all.sh script.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

### Download Root Hints
# This file is essential for Unbound to resolve top-level domains from the root servers.

### Create the Unbound configuration file
# This creates a minimal configuration that runs Unbound in fully recursive mode.

    # Enable DNSSEC validation to ensure authenticity of DNS responses,
